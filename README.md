# PumpkinBot
## By Harrison Darbin
Hello! This is a simple bot used for personal Discord servers with friends! \
I don't really expect anybody else to work on this, so to those viewing for other reasons, this is just a basic, early example of my work in both JavaScript and NodeJs.\
Features include:
 - Custom message storage (w!add)
 - Random message display (wotbot)
 - User specific random responses
 - Posture fixing reminders
